# Convex-Probles-with-Affine-Equality-Constrains
The problem which we are going to study is an convex problem with affine equality constrains.

![image affine problem](https://github.com/ekaratarakis/Convex-Probles-with-Affine-Equality-Constrains/blob/master/Images/affine%20problem.jpg)

where A belongs to R+^{pxn}, rank(A) = p and b belongs to R+{p}.
## Solving with CVX
An extremely good approach of the problem's solution can be obtained via CVX which is a Mathworks product. Further information in the link below
